2. Statistical Summary of the Data
The statistical analysis of the pump performance dataset offers valuable insights into the different operational features, helping identify potential predictors of pump failure. Below is a detailed summary of the key features:
Vibration Level:
•	Average (0.501933): The average vibration level is around 0.50, indicating relatively stable operations with a low standard deviation (0.097922). This suggests that the vibration levels do not fluctuate drastically during the pump's operation.
•	Range (0.175873 to 0.885273): The minimum and maximum values show moderate variability in vibration levels. The upper limit of this range (0.885273) could potentially indicate abnormal operating conditions, and monitoring it might help predict failures.
•	Implication: If higher vibration levels are found to be associated with failures, the maximum value in this range may serve as a critical threshold.


Temperature:
•	Average (70.354181): The average temperature is approximately 70°C, with a larger standard deviation (4.987272), indicating more variation compared to vibration levels.
•	Range (55.298057 to 85.965538): The temperature readings vary significantly, with the maximum value nearing 86°C. The higher temperature readings could be an indicator of overheating, which may precede pump failure.
•	Implication: If failures occur more frequently at higher temperatures, monitoring the upper end of the range could be crucial in preventing pump malfunctions.
Pressure:
•	Average (100.058342): The average pressure is around 100 PSI, with a standard deviation of 9.834543, showing more variability than both vibration and temperature.
•	Range (69.804878 to 139.262377): The pressure readings range from as low as 69 PSI to as high as 139 PSI, indicating that the pump operates under varying pressure conditions.
•	Implication: Extreme pressure readings, both low and high, might be related to potential failures. Analyzing pressure trends, especially before failures, could help identify critical thresholds for safe operation.
Flow Rate:
•	Average (49.906404): The average flow rate is around 50 m³/h, with moderate variability, indicating a generally consistent flow performance.
•	Range (35.352757 to 66.215465): Flow rate variations are evident, with lower readings potentially indicating blockages or reduced efficiency.
•	Implication: Monitoring both low and high flow rates in relation to failure events could help identify if deviations from the average are early indicators of pump issues.
General Observations:
•	Feature Variability: Among the features, pressure and temperature show more variability compared to vibration and flow rate. This suggests that they may play a more significant role in predicting pump failures.
•	Potential Outliers: The extreme minimum and maximum values within each feature may represent outliers or edge cases. Investigating these could provide insights into the critical conditions that lead to failure.
•	Sensor Interaction: It may be useful to explore interactions between different features, such as high pressure combined with high temperature, to see if these conditions jointly contribute to failures.
This statistical summary provides a foundation for deeper analysis, such as correlating feature values with failure events and developing predictive models to prevent pump malfunctions. Understanding these key metrics and their implications is vital in building a robust failure prediction model.

3. Feature Understanding
In this dataset, the primary goal is to predict pump failure based on various operational metrics. Below is an understanding of the features and their relationship with the target variable:
Target Variable:
•	Failure: This column represents whether a pump failure has occurred or not. It is a binary classification target, where a value of 1 indicates failure and 0 indicates no failure.
Features:
1.	Vibration Level:
o	Description: This feature measures the vibration level of the pump, which could be a critical indicator of mechanical issues. High vibration levels might indicate problems such as misalignment or wear, which could lead to failure.
o	Impact on Failure: Changes in vibration levels, especially at higher ranges, may correlate with failures, making this feature an essential predictor.
2.	Temperature (°C):
o	Description: The temperature of the pump during operation is a crucial factor in understanding the pump's health. Elevated temperatures might indicate overheating, which could be a precursor to failure.
o	Impact on Failure: A significant increase in temperature could suggest that the pump is under stress, potentially leading to failure if not addressed.
3.	Pressure (PSI):
o	Description: This feature measures the pressure within the pump system. Maintaining optimal pressure is vital for pump performance. Abnormal pressure readings could indicate issues such as blockages or leaks.
o	Impact on Failure: Both extremely high and low-pressure readings could signal problems, making this feature a valuable indicator of potential failures.
4.	Flow Rate (m³/h):
o	Description: The flow rate represents the volume of fluid the pump moves per hour. It is a key performance metric that reflects the pump's efficiency. Variations in flow rate could indicate performance issues.
o	Impact on Failure: A decrease in flow rate might suggest blockages or reduced pump efficiency, potentially leading to failure if not corrected.
Summary:
The features—vibration level, temperature, pressure, and flow rate—collectively provide insights into the pump's operational health. The objective of this classification model is to use these features to predict the occurrence of a pump failure. Understanding how each feature contributes to the failure event is essential for building an effective predictive model. By monitoring and analysing these features, it is possible to identify patterns that precede failure, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.

4. Analysing the Target: Class Imbalance
In any classification task, it's crucial to understand the distribution of the target variable, as an imbalance can significantly impact model performance. This dataset presents a clear case of class imbalance, where the majority class (non-failure) far outweighs the minority class (failure).

Failure/Non-Failure Imbalance:
•	Total Readings: 1000
•	Pump Failures: 49 instances (4.9%)
•	Non-Failures: 951 instances (95.1%)
Observations:
•	Imbalance Ratio: The data shows a substantial imbalance with a failure to non-failure ratio of approximately 1:19. This means that failures are relatively rare events, making it challenging for a model to accurately predict them without appropriate handling of the imbalance.

5. Correlation Analysis with Target Column
In this section, the correlation between each feature and the target variable, failure, was calculated. The goal is to identify which features have the strongest linear relationships with the likelihood of pump failure. Here are the key observations:
1.	Vibration Level (Correlation: 0.021784):
o	The correlation between vibration level and failure is almost zero, indicating a very weak linear relationship.
o	Implication: Vibration levels do not significantly impact the likelihood of failure, suggesting that it may not be a strong predictor in this dataset.
2.	Temperature (Correlation: 0.052382):
o	Similar to vibration level, the correlation between temperature and failure is very close to zero, indicating a weak linear relationship.
o	Implication: Temperature appears to have little effect on the probability of failure based on this data.
3.	Pressure (Correlation: 0.235530):
o	The positive correlation suggests that as pressure increases, the probability of failure tends to increase. While this relationship is not particularly strong, it is notable compared to other features.
o	Implication: Higher pressure could be associated with an increased risk of failure, making it a feature worth monitoring in predictive models.
4.	Flow Rate (Correlation: -0.274590):
o	The negative correlation indicates that as the flow rate increases, the likelihood of failure decreases. Although the relationship is not very strong, it suggests that higher flow rates may reduce the risk of failure.
o	Implication: Flow rate could be a protective factor, where maintaining higher flow rates may help in preventing pump failures.
Conclusion:
•	Pressure and Flow Rate show the most notable correlations with failure, even though they are not particularly strong. These features may still be valuable in predictive modelling, while Vibration Level and Temperature seem to have minimal impact on the likelihood of pump failure. Further analysis, such as feature interactions or non-linear modelling, may help uncover deeper relationships that are not captured by simple correlations.
6. Checking for Non-Linear Patterns
Observations:
•	The scatter plots do not show any distinct clusters or patterns between the features (vibration level, temperature, pressure, and flow rate) and the target variable (failure).
•	Data points are spread out without a noticeable trend, indicating weak or no non-linear relationships between the features and failure events.
Conclusion:
•	There is no strong evidence of non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable. Therefore, simpler linear models may suffice for this dataset, although exploring more complex models could still uncover potential hidden patterns.

7. Distribution Analysis Using Histograms
The histograms provide an overview of the distribution of each feature, helping to understand the variability and operational range within the dataset:
•	Vibration Level: Shows a roughly normal distribution centred around 0.5, indicating stable operations with consistent vibration levels and few extreme values.
•	Temperature (°C): Also follows a normal distribution around 70°C, with most readings between 60°C and 80°C, suggesting controlled temperature fluctuations during operation.
•	Pressure (PSI): Displays a normal distribution centred around 100 PSI, with values ranging from 70 to 140 PSI, reflecting moderate variability in operating pressure.
•	Flow Rate (m³/h): Exhibits a normal distribution around 50 m³/h, with most readings between 35 and 65 m³/h, indicating consistent flow performance with minimal extreme values.
Conclusion:
All features demonstrate approximately normal distributions, suggesting that the pump operates under stable conditions most of the time. Deviations from these central values may indicate potential anomalies or precursors to pump failures.

8. Outlier Detection Using Boxplots
The boxplots highlight potential outliers across the dataset:
•	Vibration Level: A few outliers are detected above 0.8 and below 0.2, suggesting rare or unusual vibration conditions.
•	Temperature (°C): Outliers appear below 60°C and above 80°C, potentially indicating abnormal cooling or overheating events.
•	Pressure (PSI): Outliers above 130 PSI suggest high-pressure conditions that could stress the pump.
•	Flow Rate (m³/h): Outliers below 40 and above 60 m³/h may indicate flow inefficiencies or blockages.
Conclusion:
The presence of outliers in each feature suggests potential indicators of abnormal pump behaviour. Investigating these outliers could provide insights into conditions that may lead to failures.

9. Time Series Analysis with Failure Events
The time series plots, with failure events marked in red, provide insights into the relationship between pump performance features and failures:
•	Vibration Level: Failures occur across various vibration levels with no clear pattern, suggesting vibration is not a strong standalone indicator.
•	Temperature: Failure events are spread across the entire temperature range, indicating temperature fluctuations alone do not strongly correlate with failures.
•	Pressure: Failures appear at both low and high pressures, with a slight clustering at higher values, hinting at a possible but weak relationship.
•	Flow Rate: Failures are more frequent at lower flow rates, suggesting reduced flow might be linked to failures, though the pattern is not conclusive.
Conclusion:
There are no strong individual patterns linking these features to failures. Slight tendencies observed at high pressures and low flow rates may require further investigation, potentially considering interactions between multiple features.

10. Basic Model Development and Evaluation

•	Recall: 0.8578
•	F1 Score: 0.9027
XGBoost offers good performance with balanced precision and recall. Although its recall is slightly lower than the Decision Tree, it provides a solid balance of detecting failures while maintaining fewer false positives.

12. Overfitting Check for the Models based on the Scores and Learning Curves
•	Decision Tree:
o	The learning curve shows a perfect training score (red line at 1.0) throughout, indicating that the model fits the training data completely.
o	However, the cross-validation score (green line) starts lower and gradually improves, but there remains a gap between training and validation scores.
o	This suggests that the Decision Tree may be overfitting the training data, memorizing it rather than generalizing well to new data.
•	Random Forest:
o	The learning curve also shows a near-perfect training score, with the red line staying at 1.0 for most of the data.
o	The cross-validation score improves rapidly with more data but plateaus below the training score, suggesting slight overfitting.
o	While Random Forest generalizes better than the Decision Tree, it still shows signs of overfitting due to the gap between training and cross-validation scores.
•	XGBoost:
o	The learning curve for XGBoost shows a high training score that is not perfect, indicating that the model is not overfitting to the training data.
o	The cross-validation score steadily improves and converges closer to the training score, demonstrating that the model generalizes well with more data.
o	This convergence suggests that XGBoost maintains a good balance between fitting the training data and performing well on unseen data, making it the most robust model among the three.
By analysing the learning curves, XGBoost is identified as the best-performing model, with minimal overfitting and strong generalization capabilities.

13. Selecting XGBoost as the Best Model
